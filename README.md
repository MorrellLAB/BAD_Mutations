BAD_Mutations
============

Overview
--------
`BAD_Mutations` (**B**LAST-**A**ligned-**D**eleterious?) performs a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) for the prediction of deleterious variants, as described in
[Chun and Fay (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.092619.109). The
package is designed to identify deleterious variants in plant species.
`BAD_Mutations` is first used in [Kono et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw102), with publication detailing features of the software to follow.
