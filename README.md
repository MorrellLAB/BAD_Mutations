BAD_Mutations
============

Overview
--------
BAD_Mutations (**B**LAST-**A**ligned-**D**eleterious?) performs a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) for the prediction of deleterious variants, as described in 
[Chun and Fay (2009)](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1553.abstract). The
package is designed to identify deleterious variants in plant species.
BAD_Mutations is first used in *Kono et al. (In Prep.)*, with publication
detailing features of the software to follow.

For more information, see the user manual.

TODO
----
* Implement dependency downloading
* Add native support for parallel processing
* Add support for SNPs in nucleotide sequence positions
