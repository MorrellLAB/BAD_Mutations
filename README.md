BAD_Mutations
============

Overview
--------
BAD_Mutations (**B**LAST-**A**ligned-**D**eleterious?) performs a likelihood
ratio test (LRT) for the prediction of deleterious variants, as described in 
[Chun and Fay (2009)](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1553.abstract). The
package is designed to identify deleterious variants in plant species.
BAD_Mutations is first used in
[Kono et al. (2016)](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/9/2307.full),
with publication detailing features of the software to follow.

* Implement dependency downloading
* Add native support for parallel processing
* Add support for SNPs in nucleotide sequence positions
